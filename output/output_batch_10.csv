We will use this information to determine your highest spend category. Citibank shall have the sole right to determine the highest spend category each billing cycle and their decision will be final.

We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of identifying your spend category.&nbsp;Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category as recognized by Citi, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, your purchase amount will not be included in the spend for that billing cycle. For example, your purchase amount would not be included in the restaurant category for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned&nbsp;a \""retailer\"" code instead of a \""restaurant\"" code.&nbsp; Please also note – purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not be included in the anticipated category depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase.

We don’t control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn’t grouped into that category as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional points. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a “retailer” code instead of a “restaurant” code. Please also note - purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional points depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase.

Credit card reward certificates are redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise or cash back. An alternative form for redemption other than within the warehouse may be provided at Citi and/ or Costco's discretion. The credit card reward certificate, or alternative-form distribution, will contain your cash back rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash or an alternative form (e.g. check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Requests to redeem the credit card reward certificate for cash may be fulfilled in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Your credit card reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in the year in which it is issued, unless an alternative form for redemption is provided (at Citi and/or Costco's discretion). Any cash back rewards you have earned on purchases made by Authorized Users on your Card Account will be added to your cash back rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize may redeem the certificate as long as you or the authorized individual has a valid Costco membership. You will not receive a credit card reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent.

With the exception of special account status or circumstances (e.g. Military relief programs), the anniversary month will coincide with the month in which the annual fee is billed. To receive the Flight Discount, your account must be open for one full billing cycle after your anniversary month. For your first year of credit cardmembership, purchases qualify as of the date of your account opening. The Flight Discount expires one year from date of issue of the certificate. The Flight Discount is redeemable toward the initial ticket purchase of air travel only on flights marketed or operated by American Airlines or American Airlines codeshare flights for itineraries originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold in US Dollars. The Flight Discount is redeemable online at aa.com, or by calling American Airlines Reservations. A reservations services fee may apply for travel booked through American Airlines Reservations. The Flight Discount is redeemable only toward the purchase of the base airfare and directly associated taxes, fees and charges that are collected as part of the fare calculation for travel. The Flight Discount cannot be used to pay the taxes and charges on mileage redemption tickets where only taxes and fees are being collected. The Flight Discount may not be used for flight products and/or services that are sold separately or non-flight products and/or services sold by American Airlines. If the ticket price is greater than the value of the Flight Discount, the difference must be paid only with a credit, debit or charge card, or with American Airlines Gift Cards. Any unused balance can be applied towards eligible future travel until the stated expiration date. If travel booked with the Flight Discount is cancelled or changed by the credit cardmember, the Flight Discount will be forfeited and the credit cardmember will be responsible for any applicable fare difference and the applicable change fee.

You also won't earn 2X Points if the merchant does not classify itself as a gas station by using the gas station merchant code.

We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional rewards. For example, you won't earn additional points for supermarket purchases if the merchant is not assigned a supermarket-related code. Please also note &mdash; purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional points depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional points.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cstrong>Round Up\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>For every purchase that earns ThankYou Points, your ThankYou Points will be rounded up to the nearest 10 points so that the total ThankYou Points awarded for any purchase is in a 10-ThankYou-Point increment (\\\""Round Up\\\""). For example, if you purchase an item that costs $3.48, you'll receive 10 ThankYou Points; and if you purchase an item that costs $9.51, you'll receive 10 ThankYou Points. Points are rounded after the additional points are awarded for 2X qualifying purchases. For example, if you make a $7 purchase that earns 2X Points, that purchase would qualify for 14 ThankYou Points, which will be rounded up to 20 ThankYou Points.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cstrong>10% Points Back from Redemptions\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>When you redeem your ThankYou Points, you'll receive 10% points back for the first 100,000 ThankYou Points redeemed per calendar year.

We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional cash back rewards. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a \\\""retailer\\\"" code instead of a \\\""restaurant\\\"" code. Please also note &mdash; purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional cash back rewards depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase.

Credit card reward certificates are redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise or cash back. An alternative form for redemption other than within the warehouse may be provided at Citi and/ or Costco's discretion. The credit card reward certificate, or alternative-form distribution, will contain your cash back rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash or an alternative form (e.g. check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Requests to redeem the credit card reward certificate for cash may be fulfilled in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Your credit card reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in the year in which it is issued, unless an alternative form for redemption is provided (at Citi and/or Costco's discretion). Any cash back rewards you have earned on purchases made by Authorized Users on your Card Account will be added to your cash back rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize may redeem the certificate as long as you or the authorized individual has a valid Costco membership. You will not receive a credit card reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent. Any cash back rewards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited, unless prohibited by law or otherwise indicated below.

We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of identifying your spend category. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category as recognized by Citi, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, your purchase amount will not be included in the spend for that billing cycle. For example, your purchase amount would not be included in the restaurant category for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a &#34;retailer&#34; code instead of a &#34;restaurant&#34; code. Please also note – purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not be included in the anticipated category depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase.

To receive the Flight Discount, your account must be open for one full billing cycle after your anniversary month. For your first year of credit cardmembership, purchases qualify as of the date of your account opening. The Flight Discount expires one year from date of issue of the certificate. The Flight Discount is redeemable toward the initial ticket purchase of air travel only on flights marketed or operated by American Airlines or American Airlines codeshare flights for itineraries originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold in US Dollars. The Flight Discount is redeemable online at aa.com, or by calling American Airlines Reservations. A reservations services fee may apply for travel booked through American Airlines Reservations. The Flight Discount is redeemable only toward the purchase of the base airfare and directly associated taxes, fees and charges that are collected as part of the fare calculation for travel.

Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional cash back rewards. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a \\\""retailer\\\"" code instead of a \\\""restaurant\\\"" code. Please also note &mdash; purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional cash back rewards depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional cash back rewards.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Returns:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Returned items may result in credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce or may eliminate accumulated cash back rewards and may result in a negative cash rewards balance. If your Card Account has a negative cash back rewards balance, any newly earned cash back rewards will be used to offset such negative cash back rewards balance until such balance has been brought to zero.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Receiving & Redeeming Cash Back Rewards:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Your reward is distributed annually once your February billing statement closes. Your reward is distributed in the form of a credit card reward certificate, unless your annual reward amount is greater than $10,000, in which case Citi and Costco reserve the right to distribute your reward in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at Citi's and/or Costco's discretion. Credit card reward certificates are redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise or cash back. An alternative form for redemption other than within the warehouse may be provided at Citi and/ or Costco's discretion. The credit card reward certificate, or alternative-form distribution, will contain your cash back rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash or an alternative form (e.g. check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Requests to redeem the credit card reward certificate for cash may be fulfilled in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Your credit card reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in the year in which it is issued, unless an alternative form for redemption is provided (at Citi and/or Costco's discretion). Any cash back rewards you have earned on purchases made by Authorized Users on your Card Account will be added to your cash back rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize may redeem the certificate as long as you or the authorized individual has a valid Costco membership. \u003Cstrong>You will not receive a credit card reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent. Any cash back rewards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited, unless prohibited by law or otherwise indicated below. You must maintain your Costco Membership to redeem your credit card reward certificate, unless prohibited by law.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Account Closure:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If we are notified of your death, earned cash back rewards will be distributed via check to the executor or administrator of your estate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If we close your Card Account for any other reason, you will no longer be able to earn cash back rewards, and you will forfeit any cash back rewards accumulated, but not yet distributed, unless prohibited by law. If you close or convert your Card Account prior to receiving the credit card reward certificate in your February billing statement, any earned cash back rewards will be forfeited, unless prohibited by law.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Forfeiture:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Any cash back rewards not redeemed by December 31 of the year of issuance of the credit card reward certificate will be forfeited.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Value of Cash Back Rewards:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Value of Cash Back Rewards: cash back rewards have no cash value until such time as they are redeemed.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Property Rights:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>You have no property rights or other legal interests in cash back rewards. Cash back rewards may not be transferred to any other person including through such events as inheritance, bankruptcy or divorce. cash back rewards cannot be assigned or pledged.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Changes to Program Rules:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>We may make changes to the cash back rewards Program at any time, and if required by law, will provide notice. We will give you advanced written notice if we make any of the following changes: a change that negatively affects the number of cash back rewards you can earn, a change that negatively affects how/when you may lose your cash back rewards, a change that negatively affects how you can exercise your rights with respect to cash back rewards, or if we cancel the program.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Fraud, Misuse, Abuse or Suspicious Activity:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If we see evidence of fraud, misuse, abuse, or suspicious activity, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we reserve the right to take action against you and your account. This may include, without limitation and without prior notice, any or all of the following:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Taking away your accrued cash back rewards you earned because of fraud, misuse or abuse.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Preventing you from earning cash back rewards.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Suspending or closing your Card Account or cash back rewards account.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Taking legal action to recover cash back rewards redeemed because of such activity and to recover our monetary losses, including litigation costs, and damages.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Examples of activities that may trigger such actions include, but are not limited to, the following:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Using your Card Account in an abusive manner for the primary purpose of acquiring cash back rewards.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>Using your Card Account other than primarily for personal, consumer or household purposes.\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/div>\""}"",""GROUP_TYPE"":""Container"",""SET_NOTIFICATION"":""N"",""CONTENT_ID"":""HP_CostcoC_App_STD_Evrydy"",""NAME"":""HP_CostcoC_App_STD_Evrydy""},""copy$$HP_DC_D2A_STD_CBNF"":{""SUBGROUP_TYPE"":""Container"",""TEXT"":""{\n \""contentID\"": \""HP_DC_D2A_STD_CBNF\"",\n \""hdText\"": \""CITI DOUBLE CASH\u003Csup>&reg;\u003C/sup> CARD\"",\n \""subText\"": \""Earn $200 Cash Back Bonus\"",\n \""descriptionText\"": \""Earn $200 cash back after spending $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening.

You also won't earn 2X Points if the merchant does not classify itself as a gas station by using the gas station merchant code. Therefore, you may not earn 2X Points for purchases made at warehouse clubs, wholesale clubs, superstores, discount stores, department stores, and convenience stores.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cstrong>Merchant Classification for Rewards Categories\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Merchants are assigned a merchant category code (\\\""MCC\\\""), which is determined in accordance with Visa/Mastercard/American Express procedures based on the kinds of products and services the merchants primarily sell. We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional rewards. For example, you won't earn additional points for supermarket purchases if the merchant is not assigned a supermarket-related code. Please also note &mdash; purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional points depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional points.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cstrong>Round Up\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>For every purchase that earns ThankYou Points, your ThankYou Points will be rounded up to the nearest 10 points so that the total ThankYou Points awarded for any purchase is in a 10-ThankYou-Point increment (\\\""Round Up\\\""). For example, if you purchase an item that costs $3.48, you'll receive 10 ThankYou Points; and if you purchase an item that costs $9.51, you'll receive 10 ThankYou Points. Points are rounded after the additional points are awarded for 2X qualifying purchases. For example, if you make a $7 purchase that earns 2X Points, that purchase would qualify for 14 ThankYou Points, which will be rounded up to 20 ThankYou Points.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cstrong>10% Points Back from Redemptions\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>When you redeem your ThankYou Points, you'll receive 10% points back for the first 100,000 ThankYou Points redeemed per calendar year. This means that if you redeem 10,000 ThankYou Points, you'll receive 1,000 ThankYou Points from the 10% Points Back feature.

We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category as recognized by Citi, your purchase will not qualify for additional cash back rewards. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a \\\""retailer\\\"" code instead of a \\\""restaurant\\\"" code. Please also note &mdash; purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional cash back rewards depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional cash back rewards.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Returns:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Returned items may result in credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce or may eliminate accumulated cash back rewards and may result in a negative cash rewards balance. If your Card Account has a negative cash back rewards balance, any newly earned cash back rewards will be used to offset such negative cash back rewards balance until such balance has been brought to zero.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Receiving & Redeeming Cash Back Rewards:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Your reward is distributed annually once your February billing statement closes. Your reward is distributed in the form of a credit card reward certificate, unless your annual reward amount is greater than $10,000, in which case Citi and Costco reserve the right to distribute your reward in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at Citi's and/or Costco's discretion. Credit card reward certificates are redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise or cash back. An alternative form for redemption other than within the warehouse may be provided at Citi and/ or Costco's discretion. The credit card reward certificate, or alternative-form distribution, will contain your cash back rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash or an alternative form (e.g. check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Requests to redeem the credit card reward certificate for cash may be fulfilled in an alternative form (e.g., a check or electronic transfer), at the Costco warehouse's discretion. Your credit card reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in the year in which it is issued, unless an alternative form for redemption is provided (at Citi and/or Costco's discretion). Any cash back rewards you have earned on purchases made by Authorized Users on your Card Account will be added to your cash back rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize may redeem the certificate as long as you or the authorized individual has a valid Costco membership. \u003Cstrong>You will not receive a credit card reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent. Any cash back rewards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited, unless prohibited by law or otherwise indicated below.

We will give you advanced written notice if we make any of the following changes: a change that negatively affects the number of cash back rewards you can earn, a change that negatively affects how/when you may lose your cash back rewards, a change that negatively affects how you can exercise your rights with respect to cash back rewards, or if we cancel the program.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Fraud, Misuse, Abuse or Suspicious Activity:\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If we see evidence of fraud, misuse, abuse, or suspicious activity, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we reserve the right to take action against you and your account.

With the exception of special account status or circumstances (e.g. Military relief programs), the anniversary month will coincide with the month in which the annual fee is billed. To receive the Flight Discount, your account must be open for one full billing cycle after your anniversary month. For your first year of credit cardmembership, purchases qualify as of the date of your account opening. The Flight Discount expires one year from date of issue of the certificate. The Flight Discount is redeemable toward the initial ticket purchase of air travel only on flights marketed or operated by American Airlines or American Airlines codeshare flights for itineraries originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold in US Dollars. The Flight Discount is redeemable online at aa.com, or by calling American Airlines Reservations. A reservations services fee may apply for travel booked through American Airlines Reservations. The Flight Discount is redeemable only toward the purchase of the base airfare and directly associated taxes, fees and charges that are collected as part of the fare calculation for travel. The Flight Discount cannot be used to pay the taxes and charges on mileage redemption tickets where only taxes and fees are being collected. The Flight Discount may not be used for flight products and/or services that are sold separately or non-flight products and/or services sold by American Airlines. If the ticket price is greater than the value of the Flight Discount, the difference must be paid only with a credit, debit or charge card, or with American Airlines Gift Cards. Any unused balance can be applied towards eligible future travel until the stated expiration date. If travel booked with the Flight Discount is cancelled or changed by the credit cardmember, the Flight Discount will be forfeited and the credit cardmember will be responsible for any applicable fare difference and the applicable change fee. The Flight Discount will not be replaced for any reason. The Flight Discount is non-refundable, may not be sold and has no cash redemption value.

With the exception of special account status or circumstances (e.g. Military relief programs), the anniversary month will coincide with the month in which the annual fee is billed. To receive the Flight Discount, your account must be open for one full billing cycle after your anniversary month. For your first year of credit cardmembership, purchases qualify as of the date of your account opening. The Flight Discount expires one year from date of issue of the certificate. The Flight Discount is redeemable toward the initial ticket purchase of air travel only on flights marketed or operated by American Airlines or American Airlines codeshare flights for itineraries originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold in US Dollars. The Flight Discount is redeemable online at aa.com, or by calling American Airlines Reservations. A reservations services fee may apply for travel booked through American Airlines Reservations. The Flight Discount is redeemable only toward the purchase of the base airfare and directly associated taxes, fees and charges that are collected as part of the fare calculation for travel. The Flight Discount cannot be used to pay the taxes and charges on mileage redemption tickets where only taxes and fees are being collected. The Flight Discount may not be used for flight products and/or services that are sold separately or non-flight products and/or services sold by American Airlines. If the ticket price is greater than the value of the Flight Discount, the difference must be paid only with a credit, debit or charge card, or with American Airlines Gift Cards. Any unused balance can be applied towards eligible future travel until the stated expiration date. If travel booked with the Flight Discount is cancelled or changed by the credit cardmember, the Flight Discount will be forfeited and the credit cardmember will be responsible for any applicable fare difference and the applicable change fee. The Flight Discount will not be replaced for any reason. The Flight Discount is non-refundable, may not be sold and has no cash redemption value. After qualification, please allow 8-12 weeks for delivery of the Flight Discount.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>No Mileage Cap\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>There is no maximum number of American Airlines AAdvantage\u003Csup>&reg;\u003C/sup> miles that you can accumulate through your Citi\u003Csup>&reg;\u003C/sup> / AAdvantage\u003Csup>&reg;\u003C/sup> credit card account.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If Citi sees evidence of fraud, misuse, abuse, or suspicious activity, as determined by Citi in its sole discretion, Citi reserves the right to take action against you and your credit card account.
